# TI-BASIC
Wow stuff I made in TI-BASIC.

Here is the stuff you can use:

  -Amazing Quote Machine: Inserts random quotes whenever needed.

  -ARITHI: Calculate place in arithmetic sequence through regression (i.e. you have a^23, and a^8, but want to find a^34.
  -ARITHS: Standard Arithmetic Sequence calculator. Replace 2nd Number with X to utilize ratio instead.
  -GEOMTCR: Geometric Ratio Generator: will determine ratio on a base of two different sequence results.
  -GEOMTCS: Determine place in a geometric sequence, like ARITHS
  -INVESTA: Calculate investments based on data given.
  -INVESTE: INVESTA, but the investment in continuous (variable e)
  -INVESTM: Calculates investments with monthly payments.
  -LNPMT: Calculates regular loan payments, total payments, and interest.
  -RTOCHG: Calculates the rate of change of something; I forgot what it does.
  
  I do not assume responsibility for your grade. Use responsibly, and it is recommended you clear this with your instructor before use.
  
  Long live New Saxony.
