# TI-BASIC
Wow stuff I made in TI-BASIC.

Here is the stuff you can use:

  -Amazing Quote Machine: Inserts random quotes whenever needed.
  
  -INVEST.8xp: Calculates investment returns with a constant APR and single deposit.
  Y=P(1+(r/n))^nt
  
  -INVESTC.8xp: Calculates investment returns with APR set to constant "e", otherwise known as continuous compounding, with a single deposit.
  Y=Pe^rt
 
  -INVESTR.8xp: Calculates investments that include routine payments.
   I'm not gonna even try to write the formula.
