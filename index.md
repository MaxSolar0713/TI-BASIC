Click the button that takes you to the repository up above. Here's the description:

-Amazing Quote Machine: Inserts random quotes whenever needed.

-ARITHI: Calculate place in arithmetic sequence through regression (i.e. you have a^23, and a^8, but want to find a^34.

-ARITHS: Standard Arithmetic Sequence calculator. Replace 2nd Number with X to utilize ratio instead.

-DEGRAD: Converts Degrees to Radians and Radians to Degrees. Ï€ will not be provided.

-GEOMTCR: Geometric Ratio Generator: will determine ratio on a base of two different sequence results.

-GEOMTCS: Determine place in a geometric sequence, like ARITHS

-INVESTA: Calculate investments based on data given.

-INVESTE: INVESTA, but the investment in continuous (number e)

-INVESTM: Calculates investments with monthly payments.

-LNPMT: Calculates regular loan payments, total payments, and interest.

-LOAD: If you insert the equation "(A-B)/C" and "(D-E)/F" into Y1 and Y2 you can calculate any equation with two variables, i.e. 2x+4y=10, 3x-2y=10.

-RADAR: Generates degrees of a radian circle for those of us too lazy to do it ourselves.

-RTOCHG: Calculates the rate of change of a linear function for those of us too lazy to do it ourselves.

I do not assume responsibility for your grade. Use responsibly, and it is recommended you clear this with your instructor before use.
